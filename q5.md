Approach 1:

def doubleL(n): //takes n as input
    res = [] //creating empty list
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2) //iterates through every number in n-1 and appends the doubled numbers to res. 
    return res //returns res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ') //The for loop iterates over doubleL(5) and prints each element.


Approach 2:
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]: //creates a list comprehension. It creates a list containing the values doubled from 0 to 4
    print(x, end=' : ') //the for loop iterates through everything to print the results. 

#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')
        
DoubleG(n) is a generator function. The reason why you'd use it is because it generates numbers on-the-fly, which saves memory compared to storing all values in a list.
